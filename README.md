# Kyle-Story
An amazing story about Kyle
I woke up in the morning.
I did not want to go to school.
I began to drive to school.
The freeway was pretty backed up.
I saw a crash on the freeway
Someone then crashed into me
We ran out of the car to a safer area
My car blew up
It caused a chain reaction of cars to explode
The End
